## 1. Get Started

Speed optimization is an important aspect of web development, as it can greatly impact the user experience and the overall performance of a website. Here is a general procedure for optimizing the speed of a website:

- **Measure the current performance**: Use tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, or WebPageTest to measure the current performance of the website. These tools will provide an overall score and detailed recommendations for improvement.
- **Optimize images** Large images can significantly slow down a website. Optimize images by compressing them, using appropriate image formats (such as JPEG or WebP), and using the correct size and resolution.
- **Minimize HTTP requests**: Every time a browser requests a resource (such as an image, style sheet, or script), it creates an HTTP request. Minimize the number of HTTP requests by combining and minifying resources, and using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute resources.
- **Use a caching mechanism**: Caching is the process of storing a copy of a resource locally, so that it doesn't need to be re-downloaded every time it's requested. This can greatly improve the speed of a website by reducing the number of HTTP requests.
- **Optimize code**: Optimize code by minifying and compressing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Use a build tool like webpack or gulp to automate this process.
- **Test, Measure and Monitor**: Continuously measure your website's performance and make changes as needed. Use monitoring tools such as Google Analytics, New Relic, or Loggly to track the performance of your website over

## 2. Optimize Image

WebP is an image format that supports both lossy and lossless compression. It can be used to create responsive images that can be served to different devices at different sizes and resolutions. Here is an example of how to use the picture element and source elements to create a responsive image using the WebP format:
### 2.1 Image Structure in webp format

```html
<!-- using Picture in WebP Format -->
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="My image">
</picture>
```

In this example, the browser will first look for the WebP version of the image and use it if it is supported. If the browser does not support WebP, it will fall back to the JPEG version of the image. This way, you can serve the WebP version of the image to devices that support it, and fall back to a more widely supported format like JPEG for devices that don't.

You can also use the srcset attribute to provide different versions of the image at different sizes, and the browser will choose the best one for the device.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image-small.webp" media="(max-width: 600px)" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image-medium.webp" media="(max-width: 1200px)" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image-large.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image-small.jpg" media="(max-width: 600px)" type="image/jpeg">
  <source srcset="image-medium.jpg" media="(max-width: 1200px)" type="image/jpeg">
  <source srcset="image-large.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="My image">
</picture>
```

You can also use the srcset attribute to provide different versions of the image at different sizes, and the browser will choose the best one for the device.

```html
<img src="image-small.jpg" alt="My image" class="responsive-image"
  srcset="image-small.jpg 400w, image-medium.jpg 800w, image-large.jpg 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1200px) 800px, 1200px">
```

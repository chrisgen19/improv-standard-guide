## 1. Get Started

Speed optimization is an important aspect of web development, as it can greatly impact the user experience and the overall performance of a website. Here is a general procedure for optimizing the speed of a website:

- **Measure the current performance**: Use tools such as Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, or WebPageTest to measure the current performance of the website. These tools will provide an overall score and detailed recommendations for improvement.
- **Optimize images** Large images can significantly slow down a website. Optimize images by compressing them, using appropriate image formats (such as JPEG or WebP), and using the correct size and resolution.
- **Minimize HTTP requests**: Every time a browser requests a resource (such as an image, style sheet, or script), it creates an HTTP request. Minimize the number of HTTP requests by combining and minifying resources, and using a content delivery network (CDN) to distribute resources.
- **Use a caching mechanism**: Caching is the process of storing a copy of a resource locally, so that it doesn't need to be re-downloaded every time it's requested. This can greatly improve the speed of a website by reducing the number of HTTP requests.
- **Optimize code**: Optimize code by minifying and compressing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Use a build tool like webpack or gulp to automate this process.
- **Test, Measure and Monitor**: Continuously measure your website's performance and make changes as needed. Use monitoring tools such as Google Analytics, New Relic, or Loggly to track the performance of your website over

## ![âœ”] 2.1 Structure your solution by components

**TL;DR:** The worst large applications pitfall is maintaining a huge code base with hundreds of dependencies - such a monolith slows down developers as they try to incorporate new features. Instead, partition your code into components, each gets its folder or a dedicated codebase, and ensure that each unit is kept small and simple. Visit 'Read More' below to see examples of correct project structure

**Otherwise:** When developers who code new features struggle to realize the impact of their change and fear to break other dependent components - deployments become slower and riskier. It's also considered harder to scale-out when all the business units are not separated
